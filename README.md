# Bacterial Growth Prediction using Hybrid Mechanistic and Neural Network Model

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for predicting bacterial growth using a hybrid model that combines mechanistic principles with a neural network approach implemented in PyTorch.

## Features
- Mechanistic Model: Incorporates fundamental principles of bacterial growth dynamics in the form of differentail equations
- Neural Network Model: Utilizes PyTorch for building and training a standard feedforward neural network and a LSTM
- Prediction: Predicts bacterial growth rate with input parameters

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- Numpy
- MatPlotLib
- Plotly
- Sympy

## Installation
- Clone the repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/BLADDER-PROJECT/bioreactor.git
  cd BLADDER-PROJECT
  ```
- Install dependencies under requirements using pip or other rescources
